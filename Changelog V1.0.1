Original number of lines of code is 588
Without changing to much of the actual code I managed to condense some of the lines.
I have used the knowledge I have gained since finishing this assignment.

New lines of code is 577.
There is so much more I could change, such as putting most of the ints and floats into an array.
This would significantly reduce the amount of lines of code but is to time consuming for now.
That's more of a job for V1.1

Nearly all of the comments have been removed as 90% of them were wrote in as a sarcastic response to the tutor.

Instead of creating a whole new folder for this small change, I'm going to include just the .cpp file
